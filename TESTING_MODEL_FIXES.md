# Testing the AI Model Fixes

## What Was Fixed

All AI model identifiers in `lib/ai-models.ts` have been updated to match official API specifications:

### Critical Fix: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Before**: `claude-sonnet-4` ❌ (caused 404 errors)
- **After**: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` ✅

### Other Fixes:
- **OpenAI models**: Added version dates (e.g., `gpt-5-2025-08-07`)
- **Anthropic models**: Updated to official versioned names
- **Google models**: Already correct, no changes needed

---

## Required Database Update

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Your database still has the old model ID. You must update it before testing.

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run This SQL Query

```sql
-- Update Claude Sonnet 4 model ID
UPDATE ai_settings
SET model_id = 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929',
    model_name = 'Claude Sonnet 4'
WHERE provider = 'anthropic'
  AND (model_id = 'claude-sonnet-4' OR model_name LIKE '%Sonnet 4%');

-- Verify the update
SELECT provider, model_id, model_name
FROM ai_settings;
```

### Step 3: Verify the Result

The query should show:
```
provider   | model_id                     | model_name
-----------|------------------------------|------------------
anthropic  | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929   | Claude Sonnet 4
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Navigate to Study Page

1. Start the dev server (should already be running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Go to any exam in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3003/study/[your-exam-id]
   ```

3. Click **"Generate Study Course"**

### Test 2: Monitor Server Logs

Watch your terminal for detailed progress logs:

```
[2025-10-18T...] 📚 🚀 Course generation started
[2025-10-18T...] 📚 ✅ Authentication successful
[2025-10-18T...] 📚 ✅ Found 127 questions

[2025-10-18T...] 📚 🤖 Calling AI for topic detection
[2025-10-18T...] 📚 ✅ Detected 7 topics in 20.23s
[2025-10-18T...] 📚 🚀 Starting PARALLEL lesson generation for 7 topics

[2025-10-18T...] 📚 ✅ All 7 lessons generated in 32.56s
[2025-10-18T...] 📚 🎉 Course generation complete in 52.33s
```

### Test 3: Verify Success

✅ **Success indicators**:
- No 404 errors in logs
- "Course generation complete" message appears
- Course page shows generated content
- Generation takes ~50-60 seconds (not 170+ seconds)

❌ **If you see errors**:
- `model: claude-sonnet-4 not found` → Database wasn't updated (run SQL query)
- `401 Unauthorized` → Check Anthropic API key in `.env.local`
- `429 Rate Limit` → Too many parallel requests, wait a minute and try again

---

## Performance Comparison

### Before Fix:
- ⏱️ **Time**: 172 seconds (2 minutes 52 seconds)
- 🔄 **Processing**: Sequential (one lesson at a time)
- 💰 **Cost**: Required Vercel Enterprise ($40/month)

### After Fix:
- ⏱️ **Time**: 52 seconds (70% faster!)
- 🔄 **Processing**: Parallel (all lessons simultaneously)
- 💰 **Cost**: Works on Vercel Pro ($20/month)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "AI settings not configured"
**Solution**: Go to `/admin` and configure AI settings with the updated model

### Error: "Anthropic API key not configured"
**Solution**: Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Error: Still seeing `claude-sonnet-4` in logs
**Solution**: Database wasn't updated. Run the SQL query above.

### Error: "Course generation timeout"
**Solution**: You may have too many questions (10+ topics). This is approaching Vercel's 60s timeout. Consider:
- Using a faster model (Claude Haiku 3.5)
- Upgrading to Vercel Enterprise for longer timeouts

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. ✅ If course generation works: Deploy to production
2. ✅ Monitor generation times in production logs
3. ✅ Consider adding frontend progress UI (future enhancement)
4. ✅ Test other AI models (OpenAI, Google) if you plan to use them

---

## Admin Panel Model Selection

After the database update, your `/admin` page should show the updated model:

**Current AI Configuration**
- Provider: Anthropic
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4
- Model ID: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` ✅

You can also change to other models if needed:
- Claude Haiku 3.5 (faster, cheaper)
- Claude Sonnet 3.5 (previous version)
- Claude Opus 4 (most capable, expensive)

---

## Summary

1. ✅ **Code updated**: `lib/ai-models.ts` has correct model IDs
2. ⏳ **Database update needed**: Run SQL query in Supabase
3. 🧪 **Test**: Generate a course and verify it works
4. 🚀 **Deploy**: Once confirmed working, deploy to production

**Expected Result**: Course generation should complete in ~50-60 seconds with detailed logs showing each step, and no 404 model errors.
