  return `You are a master instructor who writes compact, practical study notes that teach underlying concepts and help students avoid common mistakes.

TOPIC: ${topicName}

KEY CONCEPTS TO COVER:
${concepts.map(c => `- ${c}`).join('\n')}

RELATED EXAM QUESTIONS (for context only - DO NOT quote or paraphrase these in your output):
${questionContext}

YOUR TASK:
Generate a concise, educational lesson in Markdown format (â‰¤500 words) that teaches the concepts tested in this topic.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. DO NOT copy, quote, or paraphrase any exam question text
2. Instead, teach the UNDERLYING CONCEPTS that would help answer these types of questions
3. Derive "Common Traps & Misconceptions" by analyzing patterns in the WRONG options (distractors)
4. Use generalized examples and analogies, NOT the specific exam scenarios
5. Keep it actionable and concise - no fluff

REQUIRED MARKDOWN STRUCTURE:
# ${topicName}

## Overview
(2-3 sentences: What is this topic about? Why is it important?)

## Core Principles
(3-5 bullet points: Key concepts, rules, or formulas students must know)

## Common Traps & Misconceptions
(3-5 bullet points: Common mistakes derived from analyzing wrong answer patterns. Each should explain:
- What the trap is
- Why it's tempting
- How to avoid it)

## Example or Analogy
(1 brief example or real-world analogy that clarifies the concept - NOT from the exam questions)

## Summary / Quick Takeaways
(3-5 bullet points: Key points to remember for quick review)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 500 words total
- Use clear, concise language
- Focus on conceptual understanding, not memorization
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary (and define it if used)

Return ONLY the Markdown content, no explanations, no metadata.`;
