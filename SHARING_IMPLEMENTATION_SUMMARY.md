# Exam Sharing Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Completed

I've successfully implemented the **true sharing approach** (approach #1) that allows users to share exams with each other without data duplication.

### Files Created

1. **Database Migrations**:
   - `supabase/migrations/002_user_lookup_function.sql` - User lookup function

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `app/api/share/exam/route.ts` - Share & unshare exams
   - `app/api/share/list/route.ts` - List all shares

3. **Components**:
   - `components/share/ShareExamModal.tsx` - Sharing UI modal

4. **Documentation**:
   - `EXAM_SHARING_SETUP.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
   - This summary file

### Files Modified

1. **TypeScript Types** (`lib/supabaseClient.ts`):
   - Added `ExamShare` type
   - Added `ExamWithSharing` type

2. **Exam API** (`app/api/exams/route.ts`):
   - Updated to include sharing metadata
   - Adds `is_shared_with_me` flag to exams

3. **Home Page** (`app/page.tsx`):
   - Added share button on owned exams
   - Added "Shared" badge on received exams
   - Integrated ShareExamModal
   - Added sharing state management

## 🚀 How to Enable

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

Execute these in your Supabase SQL Editor (in order):

1. **First** (if not already run): `supabase/migrations/001_exam_sharing.sql`
2. **Second** (required): `supabase/migrations/002_user_lookup_function.sql`

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. Create an exam as User A
2. Click the share icon (Share2) on the exam card
3. Enter User B's email address
4. Click "Share Exam"
5. User B will now see the exam with a "Shared" badge

## 📊 How It Works

### User Flow

```
┌─────────────┐
│  User A     │
│  (Owner)    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       │ 1. Clicks share button
       │ 2. Enters User B email
       │ 3. POST /api/share/exam
       │
       v
┌──────────────────┐
│  exam_shares     │
│  table           │
│  - exam_id       │
│  - shared_by (A) │
│  - shared_with(B)│
└──────┬───────────┘
       │
       │ RLS Policy allows B to view exam
       │
       v
┌─────────────┐
│  User B     │
│  (Recipient)│
│  Sees "Shared" badge
└─────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

1. **Sharing**: Creates one row in `exam_shares` table
2. **Access**: RLS policy on `exams` checks `exam_shares` for permissions
3. **Viewing**: Both users see THE SAME exam (no duplication)
4. **Unsharing**: Deletes the `exam_shares` row, access revoked

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ For Exam Owners
- Share button visible only on owned exams
- Can share with any registered user (by email)
- View list of current shares
- Remove access anytime
- Original exam stays intact

### ✅ For Recipients
- Exam appears automatically in their library
- "Shared" badge indicates it's not theirs
- Can take exam normally
- Cannot modify, delete, or re-share
- No share button visible

### ✅ Security
- Row Level Security enforces all permissions
- Users can only share their own exams
- Users can only unshare exams they shared
- Email lookup is safe (returns ID only)
- No way to view other users' data

## 🆚 Comparison with Old Copying Approach

| Aspect | Old (Copying) | New (Sharing) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Implementation** | `app/api/admin/copy-exam` | `app/api/share/exam` |
| **Access** | Admin only | Any user |
| **Data** | Full duplication | Single source |
| **Updates** | Copies diverge | Always in sync |
| **Storage** | High (N × questions) | Low (1 row per share) |
| **Use Case** | Give permanent copy | Grant access |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- exam_shares table
CREATE TABLE exam_shares (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  exam_id UUID REFERENCES exams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  shared_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  shared_with UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(exam_id, shared_with)  -- Prevent duplicate shares
);
```

### RLS Policy on exams

```sql
-- Users can view:
-- 1. Their own exams (user_id = auth.uid())
-- 2. Sample exams (is_sample = true)
-- 3. Exams shared with them (EXISTS in exam_shares)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own exams, sample exams, and shared exams"
  ON exams FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id
    OR is_sample = true
    OR EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM exam_shares
      WHERE exam_shares.exam_id = exams.id
      AND exam_shares.shared_with = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### User Lookup Function

```sql
-- Safely returns user ID for given email
-- Uses SECURITY DEFINER to access auth.users
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_id_by_email(email TEXT)
RETURNS UUID
AS $$
  SELECT id FROM auth.users
  WHERE auth.users.email = get_user_id_by_email.email
  LIMIT 1;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## 📱 UI Components

### ShareExamModal Features
- Email input with validation
- Real-time share creation
- List of current shares
- One-click unshare
- Success/error messaging
- Loading states
- Responsive design

### Home Page Updates
- Share button (Share2 icon) on exam cards
- Only visible for owned exams
- "Shared" badge with Users icon
- Modal integration
- Smooth animations

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **User must exist**: Target user must be registered before sharing
2. **Email only**: Cannot share by username or ID (by design)
3. **No notifications**: Recipients don't get notified (future enhancement)
4. **Binary access**: Either full access or no access (no view-only mode)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not implemented):
- Email notifications when exam is shared
- Bulk sharing (multiple emails at once)
- Share expiration dates
- View-only vs full-access permissions
- Share analytics (who took it, scores)
- Public share links with tokens
- Share to groups/classes

## 📝 Testing Instructions

See `EXAM_SHARING_SETUP.md` for complete testing checklist.

Quick test:
```bash
# 1. Run migrations in Supabase SQL Editor

# 2. Create two test accounts
User A: testa@example.com
User B: testb@example.com

# 3. Login as User A
# 4. Upload/create an exam
# 5. Click share icon
# 6. Enter testb@example.com
# 7. Click "Share Exam"

# 8. Logout and login as User B
# 9. Should see exam with "Shared" badge
# 10. Should be able to take exam
# 11. Should NOT see share button

# 12. Login as User A again
# 13. Click share icon
# 14. Click trash icon next to share
# 15. User B loses access
```

## ✨ Summary

The true sharing system is now **fully implemented** and ready to use after running the database migrations. It provides a secure, efficient way for users to share exams without data duplication, with proper access control via Row Level Security.

The old copying approach still exists at `/admin/exam-management` but is admin-only. Both systems can coexist without conflicts.
