        MOVE to projects/Active/ or projects/Done/
```

**ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any attempt to create forbidden files in root = IMMEDIATE REJECTION


**üö® MANDATORY BUILD MONITORING PROTOCOL - PUSH AND MONITOR UNTIL SUCCESS üö®**:
- **AFTER ANY GIT PUSH**: You MUST monitor the build/deployment progress until 100% success
- **CONTINUOUS MONITORING REQUIRED**: Do NOT consider task complete after pushing code
- **BUILD FAILURE RESPONSE**: If build fails, you MUST immediately fix issues and push again
- **VERIFICATION LOOP**: Push ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Fix (if needed) ‚Üí Re-push ‚Üí Monitor until SUCCESS
- **100% SUCCESS REQUIREMENT**: Task is ONLY complete when build passes all checks:
  - ‚úÖ All CI/CD checks passing
  - ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
  - ‚úÖ No ESLint errors
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing
  - ‚úÖ Deployment successful (if applicable)
- **MONITORING COMMANDS**: Use `gh run list`, `gh run view`, or deployment platform status

**üö® MANDATORY DEPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION - CRITICAL VIOLATION PREVENTION üö®**:
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER perform git operations on main branch without EXPLICIT USER AUTHORIZATION
- **FORBIDDEN COMMANDS**: `git push origin main`, `git merge main`, `git checkout main && git push`, ANY production deployments

- **WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: ALL changes must go through develop ‚Üí staging ‚Üí user approval ‚Üí ONLY THEN main branch
- **VIOLATION REPORTING**: Immediately escalate ANY unauthorized main branch operation attempts to user

**DEPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION VALIDATION**: Before ANY git operations, verify:
1. **Target Branch Check**: Are you operating on main branch? If YES, user authorization required.
2. **User Permission Verification**: Did user explicitly authorize main branch operations using approved phrases?
3. **Workflow Compliance**: Have you followed proper develop ‚Üí staging ‚Üí approval sequence?
4. **Safe Operations**: develop branch operations require NO authorization, main branch operations ALWAYS require user authorization.

**üö® MANDATORY 100% COMPLETION PROTOCOL - NO PARTIAL SUPPORT SUCCESS üö®**:

  - Support dashboard servers: `npm run dev -- --port 3018`
  - Customer support tools: ports 3016-3020
- **CONFLICT PREVENTION**: Port 3000 is reserved for main application development server
- **VIOLATION REPORTING**: Immediately escalate ANY attempt to use port 3000 for any purpose whatsoever

**üö® ELIMINATE TOKEN-CONSERVATION BIAS - MANDATORY THOROUGHNESS**:
**NEVER** prioritize token conservation over accuracy and completeness. User has sufficient tokens.
**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS**:
- ‚ùå "I will check the most important issues" ‚Üí Should be "I will check ALL relevant issues"
- ‚ùå "I will respond to key support tickets" ‚Üí Should be "I will address ALL support tickets comprehensively"  
- ‚ùå "Let me focus on critical problems" ‚Üí Should be "Let me examine all user problems thoroughly"
- ‚ùå Skipping issue analysis due to "efficiency" concerns
- ‚ùå Limiting troubleshooting scope to save tokens

**üö® FALSE SUCCESS PREVENTION PROTOCOL üö®**:

**FORBIDDEN CUSTOMER SUPPORT SUCCESS CLAIMS**:
- ‚ùå "User satisfaction improved" - without actual user feedback validation
- ‚ùå "Support response times reduced by 40%" - without actual timing measurements
- ‚ùå "Customer issues resolved successfully" - without confirmation from customers
- ‚ùå "Support quality enhanced significantly" - without user satisfaction metrics
- ‚ùå "Problem resolution rate increased" - without actual resolution tracking data
- ‚ùå "Customer experience optimized" - without measurable user experience metrics

**REQUIRED CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVIDENCE**:
- ‚úÖ Actual user feedback and satisfaction scores (CSAT: 4.2/5 ‚Üí 4.7/5)
- ‚úÖ Measured response times with before/after comparisons (average response: 4h ‚Üí 1.5h)
- ‚úÖ Customer-confirmed issue resolution with follow-up verification
- ‚úÖ Support ticket resolution rates with actual tracking data (87% ‚Üí 94% resolved)
- ‚úÖ User experience improvements validated through customer surveys
- ‚úÖ Customer retention metrics and support-related churn data

**TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT**:
When you cannot measure support improvements:
- "I provided comprehensive support guidance but cannot measure actual customer satisfaction without user feedback"
- "The support documentation improvements require customer validation to confirm effectiveness"
- "Support process optimization requires user testing to verify improved experience"
- "Issue resolution enhancements need customer confirmation to validate success"
