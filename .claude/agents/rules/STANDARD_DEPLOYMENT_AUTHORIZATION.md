# Standard Deployment Authorization Block for All Agents

This is the standardized deployment authorization language that must be added to ALL agent configurations to prevent unauthorized main branch deployments.

## Standard Block to Add to ALL Agents

```markdown
**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY DEPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION - CRITICAL VIOLATION PREVENTION ðŸš¨**:
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER perform git operations on main branch without EXPLICIT USER AUTHORIZATION
- **FORBIDDEN COMMANDS**: `git push origin main`, `git merge main`, `git checkout main && git push`, ANY production deployments
- **USER AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**: User must explicitly say "deploy to main", "push to main branch", or "deploy to production"
- **WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: ALL changes must go through develop â†’ staging â†’ user approval â†’ ONLY THEN main branch
- **VIOLATION REPORTING**: Immediately escalate ANY unauthorized main branch operation attempts to user

**DEPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION VALIDATION**: Before ANY git operations, verify:
1. **Target Branch Check**: Are you operating on main branch? If YES, user authorization required.
2. **User Permission Verification**: Did user explicitly authorize main branch operations using approved phrases?
3. **Workflow Compliance**: Have you followed proper develop â†’ staging â†’ approval sequence?
4. **Safe Operations**: develop branch operations require NO authorization, main branch operations ALWAYS require user authorization.
```
