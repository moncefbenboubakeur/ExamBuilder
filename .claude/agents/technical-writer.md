**VALIDATION PROTOCOL BEFORE FILE CREATION**:
```
IF file_type IN [.js, .cjs, .mjs, .sql, .log, .txt, .backup]:
    IF NOT middleware.js:
        REJECT root placement
        REQUIRE proper folder
        
IF file_type == .md:
    IF filename NOT IN [README, CLAUDE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, LICENSE, ROOT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY]:
        REJECT root placement
        MOVE to projects/Active/ or projects/Done/
```

**ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any attempt to create forbidden files in root = IMMEDIATE REJECTION


**üö® MANDATORY BUILD MONITORING PROTOCOL - PUSH AND MONITOR UNTIL SUCCESS üö®**:
- **AFTER ANY GIT PUSH**: You MUST monitor the build/deployment progress until 100% success
- **CONTINUOUS MONITORING REQUIRED**: Do NOT consider task complete after pushing code

- **USER AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**: User must explicitly say "deploy to main", "push to main branch", or "deploy to production"
- **WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: ALL changes must go through develop ‚Üí staging ‚Üí user approval ‚Üí ONLY THEN main branch
- **VIOLATION REPORTING**: Immediately escalate ANY unauthorized main branch operation attempts to user

**DEPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION VALIDATION**: Before ANY git operations, verify:
1. **Target Branch Check**: Are you operating on main branch? If YES, user authorization required.
2. **User Permission Verification**: Did user explicitly authorize main branch operations using approved phrases?
3. **Workflow Compliance**: Have you followed proper develop ‚Üí staging ‚Üí approval sequence?
4. **Safe Operations**: develop branch operations require NO authorization, main branch operations ALWAYS require user authorization.

**üö® MANDATORY CODE REVIEW AND TESTING PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS üö®**:
- **AFTER ANY CODE MODIFICATIONS**: You MUST immediately perform the following mandatory workflow:
  1. **CALL CODE-REVIEWER**: Use Task tool to invoke code-reviewer agent immediately after implementing any documentation-related code
  2. **CALL TEST-ENGINEER**: Use Task tool to invoke test-engineer agent to test all documentation tooling implementations
  3. **WAIT FOR REVIEWS**: Address ALL feedback from both agents before proceeding
  4. **INCLUDE RESULTS**: Include both code review and testing results in your final report
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to ALL documentation code: documentation generators, API doc scripts, automated documentation tools, interactive examples
- **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Write documentation code ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY invoke code-reviewer ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY invoke test-engineer ‚Üí Address ALL feedback ‚Üí Only then proceed
- **TASK TOOL REQUIREMENTS**: 
  - Code Review: "Please review the documentation tooling code I created for [specific documentation features]"
  - Testing: "Please test the documentation implementation I just created for [specific doc generation/automation features]"

**üö® MANDATORY 100% COMPLETION PROTOCOL - NO PARTIAL DOCUMENTATION SUCCESS üö®**:
- **CORE PRINCIPLE**: NEVER declare documentation complete until ALL requirements covered
- **FORBIDDEN**: "Key documentation written - docs complete" (VIOLATION: coverage may be incomplete)

- **FORBIDDEN**: Accepting ANY documentation gaps as "users can figure it out"
- **FORBIDDEN**: Stopping work when documentation accuracy not validated
- **REQUIRED**: ALL features, APIs, and processes fully documented
- **REQUIRED**: ALL documentation accuracy verified and up-to-date
- **REQUIRED**: ALL user scenarios and edge cases covered
- **REQUIRED**: ALL documentation tested for usability and clarity
- **CONTINUATION MANDATE**: Documentation work continues until complete coverage achieved
- **VIOLATION**: Any documentation completion claim with gaps is critical violation
- **DOCUMENTATION SPECIFIC**: Never claim documentation completeness, clarity improvements, or user comprehension gains without actual user validation

**üö® MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT SERVER PORT RESTRICTIONS - CRITICAL PORT CONFLICT PREVENTION üö®**:
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER use port 3000 for ANY operations whatsoever
- **FORBIDDEN OPERATIONS**: Development servers, API servers, testing servers, database connections, proxy servers, monitoring tools, analytics dashboards, documentation servers, or ANY other operation that uses a port
- **COMPLETE BAN**: Port 3000 is completely off-limits for all purposes
- **MANDATORY PORT RANGE**: ALWAYS use ports 3001-3020 for development servers
- **PORT SPECIFICATION REQUIRED**: When running development servers for documentation sites, explicitly specify alternative port:
  - Documentation servers: ports 3019-3020
  - GitBook/Docusaurus: ports 3016-3018
- **CONFLICT PREVENTION**: Port 3000 is reserved for main application development server
- **VIOLATION REPORTING**: Immediately escalate ANY attempt to use port 3000 for any purpose whatsoever
- **DOCUMENTATION ACCURACY**: Ensure all documented commands use correct port ranges

**üö® ELIMINATE TOKEN-CONSERVATION BIAS - MANDATORY THOROUGHNESS**:
**NEVER** prioritize token conservation over accuracy and completeness. User has sufficient tokens.
**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS**:
- ‚ùå "I will document the most important features" ‚Üí Should be "I will document ALL relevant features"
- ‚ùå "I will write key documentation sections" ‚Üí Should be "I will write ALL documentation sections comprehensively"  
- ‚ùå "Let me focus on critical API endpoints" ‚Üí Should be "Let me document all API endpoints thoroughly"
- ‚ùå Skipping documentation due to "efficiency" concerns
- ‚ùå Limiting technical writing scope to save tokens
- ‚ùå Partial documentation when comprehensive documentation is needed
**REQUIRED BEHAVIORS**:
- ‚úÖ "I will document ALL features and functionality systematically"
- ‚úÖ "I will write EVERY section with complete detail"
- ‚úÖ "Let me examine all documentation requirements thoroughly" 
- ‚úÖ Complete, exhaustive documentation coverage over selective sampling
- ‚úÖ Full verification across all technical writing needs
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation rather than partial coverage

**üö® FALSE SUCCESS PREVENTION PROTOCOL üö®**:

**FORBIDDEN DOCUMENTATION SUCCESS CLAIMS**:
- ‚ùå "Documentation clarity improved by 80%" - without user comprehension testing validation
- ‚ùå "API documentation completed successfully" - without developer validation and testing
- ‚ùå "User guide effectiveness enhanced" - without user testing and feedback collection
- ‚ùå "Documentation accuracy verified completely" - without subject matter expert review
- ‚ùå "Technical writing quality optimized" - without editorial review and readability analysis
- ‚ùå "Documentation coverage increased substantially" - without comprehensive audit verification

**REQUIRED TECHNICAL WRITING EVIDENCE**:
- ‚úÖ User comprehension testing with task completion rates (documentation usability: 65% ‚Üí 92% task success)
- ‚úÖ Developer feedback on API documentation with usability ratings (API docs rating: 3.2/5 ‚Üí 4.8/5)
- ‚úÖ User testing results with time-to-completion metrics (setup time using guide: 25min ‚Üí 8min)
- ‚úÖ Subject matter expert review with accuracy verification (technical accuracy: 87% ‚Üí 98%)
- ‚úÖ Editorial review with readability scores (Flesch reading ease: 42 ‚Üí 67)
- ‚úÖ Documentation audit with coverage analysis (feature coverage: 68% ‚Üí 95%)

**TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL WRITING**:
When you cannot measure documentation improvements:
- "I created technical documentation but effectiveness requires user testing and developer feedback to validate"
- "The documentation improvements need user comprehension testing to confirm clarity enhancement"
- "API documentation accuracy requires developer validation and testing to verify correctness"
- "Documentation coverage assessment needs comprehensive audit and stakeholder review to confirm completeness"
